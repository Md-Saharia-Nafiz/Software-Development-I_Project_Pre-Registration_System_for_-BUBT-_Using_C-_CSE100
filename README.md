# Pre-Registration Course 2026 {Tri Semester} for (BUBT) 

This project is a Pre-Registration System for Bangladesh University of Business and Technology (BUBT). Using C++ and Object-Oriented Programming.


## 📄Description:

This project is a C++ OOP-based Pre-Registration System for BUBT students.
It simulates the pre-registration process for the 2026 Tri Semester.
The program displays a welcome message and course registration details step by step.
Students can input their personal and academic details through console prompts.
After completing the registration, it shows a confirmation message with instructions.
The program also includes Enter key navigation and Q/q to exit functionality.
## 💡 Key Concepts Used:

(i) Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Used Student class to structure the project.

(ii) Encapsulation: Protected student data with private variables and public methods.

(ii) Class & Object: Objects manage student registration and program flow.

(iv) Member Functions / Methods: inputDetails() and displayConfirmation() for modular code.

(v) Console Interaction: User-friendly prompts with Enter key navigation.

(vi) Exit Functionality: Q/q option to safely close the program.

(vii)Code Modularity: Organized functions for readability and future upgrades.

(viii) Step-by-Step Flow: Welcome → Registration → Confirmation → Exit.
## ✨ Features:

Sure ভাই! 😎 Here's a concise **✨ Features** section in English for your README.md:

---

### ✨ Features

* Interactive **console-based pre-registration system** for BUBT students.
* Displays **welcome message** and course registration information step by step.
* Allows students to **input personal and academic details** (Name, Intake, Section, ID, Department, Semester No., CGPA).
* **Enter key navigation** for moving through the registration process.
* Shows **confirmation message** after successful registration.
* Provides **exit option** using Q/q to close the program safely.
* **OOP-based structure** with `Student` class and encapsulated data.
* **Modular and readable code**, ready for future upgrades like multiple student registration.

## 🔔 Purpose:

Of course ভাই! 😎 Here’s a clean and meaningful **🔔 Purpose** section in English for your README.md:

---

### 🔔 Purpose
To **simulate the pre-registration process** of BUBT in a digital way using C++. To **practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in a real-life scenario. To help students understand how a **university registration system** works step by step.To develop skills in **user input handling and console-based interaction**. To create a **simple yet practical project** for the *Software Development I (CSE 111)* course. To demonstrate **encapsulation, classes, and object manipulation** effectively. To improve **coding style, structure, and modularity** in C++.  To showcase the importance of **automation in academic processes**.

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced:

1. Class and Object Creation to represent student data and system behavior.

2. Encapsulation for protecting data using private members and public methods.

3. Constructor and Function Usage for better code organization.

4. Input and Output Handling through console interaction.

5. Conditional Statements for managing program flow and user decisions.

6. Loop Control and Navigation using Enter key and Q/q exit system.

7. User Interface Simulation in a console-based environment.

8. Code Structuring and Modularity for clarity and future scalability.
## ▶️ How to Run:

1. Open any **C++ IDE** (e.g., Code::Blocks, Dev-C++, Visual Studio, or online compiler).
2. Copy and paste the project **source code** into a new C++ file (e.g., `main.cpp`).
3. **Compile** the program to check for any syntax errors.
4. **Run** the executable file to start the pre-registration simulation.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions and **press Enter** to move to the next step.
6. To exit the program, **press Q or q** when prompted.
